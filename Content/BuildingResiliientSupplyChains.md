title: Misconceptions about building resilient supply chains.
summary: I recently had the pleasure of joining Maria Villablanca on her Transform Talks podcast, where we discussed The Misconceptions of Building Resilient Supply Chains.

In this episode of Maria’s insightful supply chain transformation podcast, we explore why linear approaches to planning and forecasting leave supply chains vulnerable to the cascade effects of disruption.

Sharing the impact of Hack and Craft’s data science solutions, we also discuss how digital models can help supply chain leaders understand hidden drivers of their KPIs, make better strategic decisions and ultimately ensure value isn’t lost when disruptions inevitably occur.
