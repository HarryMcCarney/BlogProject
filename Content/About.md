I created this blog as I wanted somewhere to store and share various bits of content I am working on. Everything here is a work in progress, posts are frequently updated and aren't sorted chronologically.

Content reflects my interest in combining ideas from different fields, including, Network Science, Statistics, Logistics, Programming, Simulation and Philosophy.
