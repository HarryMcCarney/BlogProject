Welcome to my blog. It's something between a blog, scrapbook and notepad and most of the entries are works in progress.
I created it to store and share
various bits of content I have produced which don't fit well elsewhere.

I am the founder and chair of [Hack and Craft](https://hackandcraft.com/) which delivers technology for some of the
largest and most complex companies in the world.
Our work in simulation and data science optimises the resilience and efficiency of 80% of the world's consumer goods
supply chain.
My current focus is on [SimPath](https://simpath.io/) which utilises Network Science and Genetic Algorithms to make
global supply chains more sustainable.
I am also privileged to be a Guest Lecturer on Sussex University's postgraduate Network Science course and at their AI
Centre.

Content here reflects my interest in combining ideas from different fields - including Network Science, Statistics, Programming, Simulation and Philosophy.
Any modest success I have had is largely due to my averageness in a number of disciplines and occasional fortuitous
connections I have made between them.
I am also fortunate to work with people smarter than myself who do their best to find the sense and/or utility in my
ideas.
The blog runs on [this](https://github.com/HarryMcCarney/BlogProject) engine which I built. It's open source and, with
the usual disclaimers, free to use and contribute to.
