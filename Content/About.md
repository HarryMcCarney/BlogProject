I created this blog as I needed somewhere to store and share various bits of content I have produced. Some of them are more polished than others so the site follows more of a ‘public notes’ ethos, rather than a formal blog.  Publication of notes imposes some discipline but avoids the perfectionism that thwarted my previous attempts to maintain a blog. Everything here is a work in progress, posts are frequently updated and aren't sorted chronologically.

Content reflects my interest in combining ideas from different fields, including, Network Science, Statistics, Logistics, Programming, Simulation and Philosophy. Any modest success I have had has largely been due to my averageness in a range of disciplines and occasional fortuitous connections I have made between these fields.  I am also fortunate to have a team of people smarter than myself at [Hack and Craft](https://hackandcraft.com/) who do their best to find the sense and/or utility in my ideas. Our work in simulation and data science optimises the resilience and efficiency of 80% of the world's consumer goods supply chain, including food. 

I chose to publish the site on my own domain using an open source [blog engine](https://github.com/HarryMcCarney/BlogProject) which I wrote myself. It is important to own our own content and to retain the ability to publish directly. Algorithm-driven content platforms and social media, combined with Gen AI, undermine the internet. It won't be long before the majority of the content and profiles on sites like Twitter/X, Facebook, Medium and possibly even LinkedIn are bot-generated - including the likes and comments. People need to regroup at the corners of the web where they can think aloud together without manipulation by algorithms and bots.
