title: Digital Twins for Resilience
summary: A detailed presentation on supply chain management, focusing particularly on the concept of resilient supply chain structures.
---
I gave  talk this on a [Gemini Call](https://digitaltwinhub.co.uk/media/digital-twin-for-resilience-harry-mccarney-hack-craft/) to the UK's industry leaders on Digital Twins and their applications. 

I explain how supply chains can be represented and analysed mathematically as networks of interconnected nodes. The importance of hubs, or nodes with a higher number of connections, is highlighted, and their vulnerabilities discussed. The potential impact of disruptions, such as removing a hub, is also explored.

I also introduce a tool that allows for the visualization and analysis of a supply chain network, aiding in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities.
